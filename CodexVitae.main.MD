This is a place for my "Book of Life".Feel free to submit an issue for typos, misunderstandings, or better phrasing. I bet I will take on a discussion if approached nicely. I branch off of master and figure out a strategy as time goes by.

Beliefs about Beliefs
* Abstractions reveal hidden truths
* Concepts expand and limit your understanding of the world and others
* Realize that there is a "lens" to view life through for different people. Something that is a core definition of a person that colors their viewpoints and responses.
* Despite hard and fast logical rules and procedures being efficient and structured, the extra realizations come in applying some intuition or feeling
* Thoughts, feelings, and motivations are infectious (or infectable?) and mutable. See emotional contagion or memes.
* Ideas on paper are at least concepts in the real-world

Principles
* Apply a will to life
* Seek to understand and then to be understood either academically or personally
* Seek and stand for truth
* Don't fall for your own lies

Productivity
Chapter Two: Personal Systems
Systems and tactics for getting the most out of your life.
* Willpower is limited. Use it wisely.

[Willpower is not reliable. Systems are.](https://medium.com/the-mission/willpower-is-limited-here-s-one-way-to-work-without-it-59e8b630ea28)

* Do you care more about quantity or quality of work?
* What is the first thing you do that kicks off the productive part of your day? [The pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
* How do you prioritize?
* How do you sequence your day? Hard stuff first or last? Aim for low hanging fruit at the start and end of your day.
* Do you have rules for doing the work, i.e. touch it once or GTD's "the mind is for having ideas not holding them?"
* How do you deal with self-doubt or negative self-talk?
* Why does productivity even matter to you?
