Codex Vitae

This is a place for my "Book of Life".Feel free to submit an issue for typos, misunderstandings, or better phrasing. I bet I will take on a discussion if approached nicely. I branch off of master and figure out a strategy as time goes by.

Beliefs about Beliefs
* Abstractions reveal hidden truths
* Concepts expand and limit your understanding of the world and others
* Realize that there is a "lens" to view life through for different people. Something that is a core definition of a person that colors their viewpoints and responses.
* Despite hard and fast logical rules and procedures being efficient and structured, the extra realizations come in applying some intuition or feeling
* Thoughts, feelings, and motivations are infectious (or infectable?) and mutable. See emotional contagion or memes.

Principles
* Apply a will to life
* Seek to understand and then to be understood either academically or personally
* Seek and stand for truth
* Don't fall for your own lies
