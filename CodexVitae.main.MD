Codex Vitae

This is a place for my "Book of Life".Feel free to submit an issue for typos, misunderstandings, or better phrasing. I bet I will take on a discussion if approached nicely. I branch off of master and figure out a strategy as time goes by.

Beliefs about Beliefs
* Abstractions reveal hidden truths
* Concepts expand and limit your understanding of the world and others
* Realize that there is a "lens" to view life through for different people. Something that is a core definition of a person that colors their viewpoints and responses.
* Despite hard and fast logical rules and procedures being efficient and structured, the extra realizations come in applying some intuition or feeling
* Thoughts, feelings, and motivations are infectious (or infectable?) and mutable. See emotional contagion or memes.
* Ideas on paper are at least concepts in the real-world

Principles
* Apply a will to life
* Seek to understand and then to be understood either academically or personally
* Seek and stand for truth
* Don't fall for your own lies
* Cultivate goodness. Particulary for me, invest in family and friends. Donations have largely been a wash and volunteering... [the results suggest intact consummatory processes, but attenuated motivational ones](http://www.nature.com/tp/journal/v4/n10/full/tp2014105a.html?foxtrotcallback=true)

Productivity
Chapter Two: Personal Systems
Systems and tactics for getting the most out of your life.
* Willpower is limited. Use it wisely.
* Burning in low priority thinking and actions into nueral pathways reduces errors and frees up mental bandwidth

[The only place you need to apply willpower is to change your reaction to the cue.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/YS6FO/harnessing-your-zombies-to-help-you)  
[Willpower is not reliable. Systems are.](https://medium.com/the-mission/willpower-is-limited-here-s-one-way-to-work-without-it-59e8b630ea28)  
"Limited willpower, also known as ego depletion"

* Do you care more about quantity or quality of work? I care much more about quality of work. I will often think out a solution before implementation and it can often seem I am just sitting there. Expand more.

* What is the first thing you do that kicks off the productive part of your day? [The pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)  
* How do you prioritize? My prioritization technique changes from different life situations. For example, when I lived away from family, when I had a strict 9 - 5 job, and what free time I have all influence my prioritization techniques. Right now, I tend to pick up outstanding tasks from previous days. I will check daily and long term tasks from a queue and see if I can chip away at it today. I have also learned to allow for changes in plans and tackling immediate challenges. These changes simply get pushed off for the next day. Eventually, I either write off the task as unimportant or hand it off to someone else.
* How do you sequence your day? Hard stuff first or last? I aim for low hanging fruit at the start and end of the day. The harder tasks keep my energy levels up and allow me to talk to others. The lower stress items give me a moment to unwind.
* Do you have rules for doing the work, i.e. touch it once or GTD's "the mind is for having ideas not holding them?" I don't have rules for work besides to make an impact, do good, and find something to be proud of.
* How do you deal with self-doubt or negative self-talk? I deal with negative self-talk by taking a break and doing something I enjoy and coming back and reflecting on my doubts. I've learned that wallowing in negative emotions can reveal certain thoughts, but this comes at the expense of normal functioning.
* Why does productivity even matter to you? Productivity isn't particularly important to me as is creating something. Often, though, that means keeping to a timeline and a budget and that's where efficient use of resources comes into play. The act of putting those resources to use in a forward movement is what productivity fulfills.
